	Version 1.0.0

	* lib/cobalt.js (buildLog): logging a logObject will now use the calling
	method's severity instead of the logObject severity. so calling `#error`
	will always provide severity level 3.

	* package.json: Updates neon dependency to 2.0, adds tellurium as
	dev-dependency.

	* /test: Adds VERY basic tests before tellurium is integrated.
